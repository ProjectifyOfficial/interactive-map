Maps are a great way to leverage your website to drive traffic to your doors. A majority of maps simply show the locations of a given entity as well as an address without any further context or interactivity. In our example, we've designed a map that displays locations you can learn more about by clicking on the location. Clicking on the location triggers a popup with further information related to that specific location. You can add any information you'd like to these popups that make the most sense for your business.
